# Also Known As

# Context

You can't rotate driver. Maybe a security policy means only one person is allowed to touch the keyboard (Google has this). Maybe latency makes screen sharing intolerable. 

# Purpose

Make mobbing possible in this difficult context.

# How To

The Driver must exercise excellent driver discipline. Only type what you're instructed to type.

Only ask questions where the answer isn't obvious (avoid leading questions). 

If the mob has a facilitator, the facilitator can ask questions of the mob to lead them along, so the driver can focus on execution questions / verifying the intent of the mob. "Did you want me to click here?"

Can be combined either with [Single Navigator] or [Navigate the Navigators].
