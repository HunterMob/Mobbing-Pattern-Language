# How To

Create a shared document named "Journal". Each day create a new heading with today's date. 

In addition to "Driver" and "Navigator" roles, add a "Journalist" role to the rotation. 

The journalist makes notes about what is going on. Decisions, questions, challenges, work done, work to come back to, links to relevant documents, Git commit IDs, etc.

# Consequences

When someone has been away from the mob for a while (e.g. at the dentist), they can skim the journal to get caught up quickly without interrupting the mob.

It is also useful for interested parties that don't participate in the mob.

This practice is especially helpful in an all-remote setting, to make up for the fact that people can't just overhear the mob as they work.
