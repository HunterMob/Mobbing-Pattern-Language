Successful mobs don't all behave the same way. Sometimes a mob could be more successful but don't see what they might change.

As a pattern language, you should not try to apply all of these patterns at once. Each one has a context in which it is applicable, and a context in which it becomes an anti-pattern.

# What makes a good pattern?

- It should not be obvious. If it were obvious, we wouldn't need to talk about it.

- Ideally, it should not be universal. It applies in one context, but in another context it has zero or negative value.

- Ideally, it should be concrete and actionable. Principles matter, but aren't part of the pattern language.

These aren't hard rules, but the better patterns are likely to meet all three.
